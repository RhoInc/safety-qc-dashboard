        <div class="details"><h1 id="functionalspecifications">Functional Specifications</h1>
<h2 id="filterbymeasure">Filter by Measure</h2>
<p>This drop-down menu is used to filter the lab variable that is displayed in the chart. The default measure is set to the first variable in the data set, but the default value can be adjusted to any measure upon the project team's request. Users can select any pre-defined measure in this filter.  Selecting a measure will display the data points associated with that measure and will display the visits that the measure is collected at underneath the chart.</p>
<h2 id="filterbypreselectedcharacteristics">Filter by pre-selected characteristics</h2>
<p>The chart can be configured to have any number of data filters. Each specified filter has a drop-down menu that is used to filter the visit data that is displayed in the chart.</p>
<h2 id="totalparticipantsshown">Total Participants Shown</h2>
<p>Displayed under the header, this statement provides the total number of participants in the data set in integers as well as the percentage of participants shown to one decimal place. In the default view, all participant data is included in the chart, or 100%, unless the project team requests otherwise. When filters are used, the data shown in the histogram is manipulated and the number of participant records shown at the top of the page may increase or decrease, depending on the variable selected. </p>
<h2 id="changethexaxis">Change the X-axis</h2>
<p>The chart contains a toggle that controls the display of the x-axis. Users can view the x-axis data by study day, visit, or visit number. The x-axis displays the data point at which the measure data is collected and manipulating it changes the scale at which the measure data is plotted. Study day, visit, or visit number can be chosen for a given measure, but the chart default is to show the x-axis by study day.</p>
<h2 id="setyaxislimits">Set Y-axis Limits</h2>
<p>Users are able to adjust the lower limit of the y-axis by manipulating the input within the Lower Limit box. Users are able to adjust the upper limit of the y-axis by manipulating the input within the Upper Limit box. Each limit box has up and down arrows to adjust the value of the box by 1. Users can select an arrow to change the input or delete the current value in the box and type in a new value. When typing in a value, users must click outside of the box to apply the changes. When a user manipulates a y-axis limit, the y-axis on the chart below the controls will reflect the change.</p>
<h2 id="resetyaxislimits">Reset Y-axis limits</h2>
<p>Users can change the upper and lower y-axis limits back to the default values for a measure by selecting the "Reset Limits" button. Pressing the button will erase the current values in the upper and lower limit boxes and replace them with defaults. The chart below will also reflect the changes and will show the default axes.</p>
<h2 id="normalrangecontrols">Normal Range Controls</h2>
<p>Users can opt to change the method for the normal ranges to the following options: None, LLN-ULN, Standard Deviation, and Quantiles. The default for the normal range controls is set to "LLN-ULN", which is the upper and lower normal range specified in the data. Users may select "None", which will remove the green shading around the normal ranges and will remove the inlier count to the left of the charts. Users may also select "Standard Deviation", which will prompt the user to enter the number of standard deviations they would like to set as the normal range. Altering the default value will change the upper and lower normal range bands in the chart and will change the inlier count to the left of the chart. Users may also select "Quantiles", which prompts the user to enter an upper and lower quantile to set as the normal ranges. Altering the upper quantile will change the upper normal range band in the chart and altering the lower quantile will change the lower normal range band in the chart. Changing the normal ranges may change the number of inliers and the inlier count to the left of the chart will update based on your selections.</p>
<h2 id="viewvisitswithoutdata">View Visits Without Data</h2>
<p>Users can select the checkbox to view visits that do not contain data. Checking the box will show a timepoint for the visit. Unchecking the checkbox will hide the timepoint for visits without data; visits without data are hidden on default.</p>
<h2 id="viewunscheduledvisits">View Unscheduled Visits</h2>
<p>Users can select the checkbox to view data that is not associated with a scheduled visit. Checking the box will show a timepoint for the unscheduled visit and its associated data. Unselecting the checkbox will hide the unscheduled visit timepoint and its data; unscheduled visits are hidden on default.</p>
<h2 id="viewsmallmultiples">View Small Multiples</h2>
<p>Clicking a data point will open a listing of small multiples below the chart that contains a detailed listing of all of the participant's records. This linked table contains small charts for each measure captured in the data set as well as the participant's subject ID, age, sex, and race. When the listing appears, the data points selected will appear in a continuous gray line inside of the chart. When a user clicks outside of the selected data point, the gray line disappears along with the detailed listing.</p>
<p>Clicking a data point will perform 2 actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the raw data records, including the subject identifier, age, race, sex, and small data renderings of each measure captured in the data set </li>
<li>Create a gray line to connect the selected data points</li>
</ul>

<li>Confirm that the listing contains subject-level information about measures and and visits</li>
<li>Confirm that you can change the selected participant via the dropdown and the new subject should be highlighted in the main chart and the small multiples should update to reflect that participant's data.</li>
<li>Confirm that a dropdown labeled Normal range method appears in the controls section with four options: None, LLN-ULN, Standard Deviation, and Quantiles.</li>
<li>Confirm that selecting Standard Deviation displays a text input labeled Number of standard deviations and defaults to 1.96.</li>
<li>Confirm that selecting Quantiles displays two text inputs, one for the lower quantile and one for the upper quantile, labeled Lower quantile and Upper quantile respectively, that default to .05 and .95.</li>

        <div class="summary">Technical specifications for chart configuration. <a href="https://www.github.com/rhoinc/safety-outlier-explorer/wiki/master/configuation">see original</a> </div>

        <div class="details"><p>The most straightforward way to customize the Safety Outlier Explorer is by using a configuration object whose properties describe the behavior and appearance of the chart. Since the Safety Outlier Explorer is a Webcharts <code>chart</code> object, many default Webcharts settings are set in the <a href="https://github.com/RhoInc/safety-outlier-explorer/blob/master/src/defaultSettings.js">defaultSettings.js file</a> as <a href="#webcharts-settings">described below</a>. Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/RhoInc/Webcharts/wiki/Chart-Configuration">Webcharts documentation</a> for more details on these settings.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard Webcharts settings several custom settings not available in the base Webcharts library have been added to the Safety Outlier Explorer to facilitate data mapping and other custom functionality. These custom settings are described in detail below. All defaults can be overwritten by users.</p>
