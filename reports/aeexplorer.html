        <div class="details"><h1 id="userrequirements">User Requirements</h1>
<h2 id="filterbyprevalence">Filter by Prevalence</h2>
<p>This is a text box feature which is used to filter out all adverse events below the percentage entered. The default is 0%, but the default value can be adjusted according to the user's needs. Users can type any alphanumeric value into this box. Values must be numeric for the filter to work. After hitting Enter or clicking outside the box, the Explorer will hide the data rows where the prevalence for all groups is below the threshold entered. If any group has a prevalence at or above the threshold entered, it will be displayed on screen with all nested categories shown. To return to the default view, the user must either refresh the page or enter 0 into the filter box and again hit Enter or click outside the box.</p>
<h2 id="filterbyseriousevent">Filter by Serious Event</h2>
<p>This menu is used to filter by whether or not an event is serious in the data set. The default is set to include all events. </p>
<h2 id="filterbyseverity">Filter by Severity</h2>
<p>This menu is used to filter by adverse event severity level in the data set. The current severity levels captured are mild, moderate, and severe. The default is to display all severity levels. </p>
<h2 id="filterbyrelationship">Filter by Relationship</h2>
<p>This menu is used to filter by the relatedness categories in the data set. The options included in the chart are not related, unlikely related, probably related, definitely related. The default is to display all relationships.</p>
<h2 id="filterbyoutcome">Filter by Outcome</h2>
<p>This menu is used to filter by the outcome categories in the data set. The options included in the chart are recovered; resolved without sequelae; resolved, recovered; and resolved with sequelae.  The default is to display all outcomes. </p>
<h2 id="togglebetweenparticipantandeventsummaries">Toggle Between Participant and Event Summaries</h2>
<p>This toggle option allows the user to view the adverse events data by participant or event. Summarizing AEs by participant presents the number of participants who experienced an AE of the corresponding category at least once by group. Summarizing AEs by event presents the number of events of the corresponding category by group. The chart defaults to display the participant data, which displays the adverse events. </p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p>The Search box is used to search the category column of the table for terms of interest. Users can type any alphanumeric term into this box. After hitting Enter or clicking outside the box, the Safety Explorer will display only the categories that contain the search term entered. The search terms will also be highlighted in yellow within the category column. Text will also display next to the Search box indicating the number of categories returned with that search term. If there are no results matching the term entered, text will display next to the Search box indicating that no categories were returned with a matching search term. The table display will not change if there are no matches in the search.</p>
<h2 id="resetsearch">Reset Search</h2>
<p>To reset to the default Explorer view after conducting a search, users can click on the red X button in the alert bar which displays next to the Search box. Alternatively, users can clear the text in the Search box and hit Enter or click outside the box.</p>
<h2 id="hover">Hover</h2>
<p>By moving a mouse cursor over certain sections of the table, users can display metadata for some variables. Hovering over the ‘E’ superscript beside one of the filter labels will display an explanation of an event filter. Hovering the cursor over a particular row will highlight the row in gray. Hovering over a value in a treatment group will display the number of participants affected out of n.  Hovering over a colored data point in the AE Rate by Group column will present the percentage value for the group. Hovering over a diamond in the Difference Between Groups column will perform two actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the raw data (numerator and denominator) used to calculate the adverse event prevalence percentage for each row in the table for the selected groups.</li>
<li>Display the two treatments compared by percentage and the overall difference between them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aeratebygroupcolumn">AE Rate by Group Column</h2>
<p>The column following the Groups columns shows the rate of an adverse event by group. Each group is represented by a color-coded dot that corresponds to the color of the treatment group. The rate of the event for each group is shown on a scale by percentage. When hovering over a colored dot, the exact percentage appears for the group.</p>
<h2 id="differencebetweengroupscolumn">Difference Between Groups Column</h2>
<p>The column on the right-hand side of the table shows a graphical representation of the difference between groups in the data set. Group comparisons are represented with a color-coded diamond that corresponds to the colors of the treatment groups being compared. When hovering over a diamond, the ratios and percentages of occurrence for the event appears for the compared groups in addition to the difference between the two groups.</p>
<h2 id="shownestedrowsforasinglecategory">Show nested rows for a single category</h2>
<p>The preferred terms for a given system organ class are hidden on the default view. To show the hidden preferred terms rows, click on the '+' to the left of a given system organ class in the category column. This will expand the table to show the nested rows for this system organ class.</p>
<h2 id="hidenestedrowsforasinglecategory">Hide nested rows for a single category</h2>
<p>The preferred terms for a given system organ class are hidden on the default view. After a category has been expanded, you can hide the nested rows by clicking on the '-' to the left of a given system organ class in the category column. This will collapse the table to hide the nested rows for this system organ class.</p>
<h2 id="showdetailsview">Show Details View</h2>
<p>Clicking on a category or any of its preferred terms will open the Show Details view. This view displays the raw data for every adverse event under that system organ class and/or preferred term.</p>
<h2 id="returntothesummaryview">Return to the Summary View</h2>
<p>The Return to the Summary View button is only visible if users have clicked on a category or preferred term to show the details view. Clicking on this button returns users to the default Safety Explorer view.</p>
<h2 id="filterbypreselectedcharacteristics">Filter by pre-selected characteristics</h2>
<p>The chart can be configured to have any number of data filters. Each specified filter has a drop-down menu that is used to filter the visit data that is displayed in the chart.</p>
<h2 id="viewtreatmentgroups">View Treatment Groups</h2>
<p>The chart can be configured to show or hide any of the treatment groups found in the data. Showing only 1 treatment group will automatically hide the 'Difference Between Groups' column and the 'Total' column.</p>
<h2 id="downloadthedata">Download the data</h2>
<p>By entering the following settings {"validation": true}, users can download the data as a CSV. The CSV file will contain all of the data if no filters have been utilized. If filters have been used, the CSV file will contain the resulting data. The CSV download will be named using the following convention: major term-minor term-summary variable. The summary variable can either be 'Participant' or 'Event", depending on what the user summarized the data by using the toggle in the menu.</p>
<h1 id="regressiontests">Regression Tests</h1>

        <div class="details"><h1 id="dataguidelines">Data Guidelines</h1>
<p>AE Explorers are initialized using JSON data files that match the format created by <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/CSV">d3.csv()</a>. The chart requires a data set with one record per adverse event and optionally with placeholder rows for participants who didn't experience any adverse events over the course of the study. The chart uses column names from the ADAM data standard by default, but can be customized to work with any column names as long as the data structure is as expected. </p>
<h1 id="defaultchart">Default Chart</h1>
<p>The following table describes chart settings and data specifications required to create an AE Explorer. A sample chart using this configuration is found <a href="https://rhoinc.github.io/viz-library/examples/0008-safetyExplorer-default/ae-table/">here</a>.</p>
